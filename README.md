# Just-Smash-112-TP

Based on the existing game “Smash Hit”, “Just Smash” is a game where players can use the balls they have to hit the pyramids that appear on the screen to gain additional balls. When being hit by obstacles, they lose balls. Game is over when the player runs out of balls. The final distance travelled is recorded as the score. This is a stress relieving and entertaining game.
